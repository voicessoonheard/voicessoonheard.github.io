# Terms and information

Hi! It’s me Wilson! If you are seeing this, that must mean you are considering letting me interview you! Thanks for that! Please read this before you continue on with the form. 

-If you are signing up for an interview, you need to understand that things may happen. If you share your full name, people who don’t believe the same things you do may try to find you and hurt you. I’m not saying this is guaranteed, but please be aware of it! 
-You must be from 10-16 years of age to get these interviews. The other ages are really important too but I’m trying to represent younger kids! Do not lie about your age please, this is an important project and these are important rules!
-You cannot sign other people up without their knowing consent.
-I do not condone foul language, so if you want an interview, I don’t want to hear any curse words at all. Thanks!
-know that I may not get to you right away if you sign up for an interview and be aware of that!
-if you have to cancel your interview request or scheduled interview, contact me with the email address you have registered
-that’s it! Thank you for considering and I hope to speak with you someday!
